                </h2></header>

                   <div class="clearboth"><p>I wrote this post in case if someone got interested on Telco Billing but they dont familiar with it's basic common glosarry in a telco billing environment. These cheat words will come in handy when you're in the middle of an interview :D for a billing position. At least it came to me during one of my interview :D</p>
<p>1. What is Rating ?
Rating is a process to determine a cost for every event. This process involves the account system and the product catalog. Product catalog is a place where we store all product we sell (well, on this case, this will be all service we sell), including it's tariff. Imagine an online bookstore where they have a catalog containing what books they sell, and how much the price.</p>
<p>2. What is Charging ?
Is a logical place where the Rating process takes place. Charging means deducting or adding your balance. When you use a data service from your cellular to download a song, they will do a rating process for that event, and they will charge you a cost, deducting from your balance.
Talking about balance deducting, current IN/charging system usually have more than 1 pre-configured account that can be owned by a subscriber. Let's say main account, and dedicated account. Imagine this as a wallet, where you can store different types of money there. There are parts of money from your wallet used only to pay your SMS charge, and the other one is only to pay your Voice charge.</p>
<p>3. What is Re-rating ?
Re-rating means recount your cost for post-rated events. This usually done for discount. Imagine a package, that offers you free 10 minutes call after your 100th minutes call duration. This means that after your call duration reaches 100 minutes, then another 10 minutes call will be free of charge.</p>
<p>4. What is Billing process?
Ok, so billing means producing your invoices. Usually this is used for postpaid subscriber where they're charged in offline mode. Offline mode means not realtime, batch, bulk, you name it. This paradigm has became a key words for those Billing vendor offers a Convergence Billing solution. We will get this on next section. So how about prepaid subscriber, do they get billing invoice too ? well, no, at least not if it's not a convergence billing. Usually for prepaid subscriber, they only get bill invoices when they're doing top up for their balance. And also, the billing usually includes taxes. These taxes can be included during rating process, or only when the bill invoice produced.</p>
<p>5. What is Convergence Billing?
There are so many definition for this. Convergence billing is a billing system designed for all service events, including their own characteristics, and at the end, it produces a convergence bill for all of your services. Today's GSM world has offered lots of services. 10 years before, we can never imagine how a cellular phone can bring us a very fast data services, video call, ring back tone, music downloads, etc. Those services has their own characteristics, and therefore, there's a need for a flexible billing system that can handle this. Current IN/Charging system only provide a simple way to charge a service. It might require a software upgrade everytime you sell a new service. And not to mention today's trend, the hybrid customer, where a postpaid customer can do top up for their account using prepaid vouchers. Convergence billing tries to answer this by giving at least few things below :
a. One bill, for all types of services offered by the operators.
b. An online and realtime system, without having to wait for new billing cycle arrived to know your bill.
c. Easy to configure new service type, with it's own way-to-bill. This impacts on time to market for a new product.
d. Lot more.</p>
<p>This glosarry is as far as I can understand or remember. Feel free to comment if you dont agree with my definition. I will be more than happy to get your input.</p>
<p>Then, have a nice interview :)</p></div>

                   <div class="clearboth"><p>Every event counts....
Outthinking. Outdoing....</p>
<p>Familiar with those words ? Well yes you're right. Those are the slogans for 2 billing company in telco industries.</p>
<p>Yes, it's been 3 weeks since I quit from my previos job in J University(some of you must have been familiar with this abbreviation) as one of Development team member. Currently I work for one of telecommunication company, CDMA450 based, in Indonesia (easy guess, there's just only 1 company using this technology in Indonesia). I join here as Interconnect Billing Specialist.</p>
<p>It's been almost 3 years since I decided to move on to my next career path. Hard decision I guess. Well, of course there's a reason and hope. Also, there's a prayer and faith why I decided to resign. It's the billing world that makes me fall in love with telco.</p>
<p>I remember my first chance in billing world was in 2006, when I sent my CV, apply to a company as a Billing staff, got accepted, but the situation was a little bit difficult that day, my wife will gave birth soon, and I thought that this wasnt the right time to move, so I stayed.</p>
<p>My second chance in billing world, came during a project in Indosat. Also, got recommended by one of my campus senior. Again, the time seems didnt fit. I got weblogic training to Hong Kong at the same month, it's a hard choice, but at least I still got my loyalty. It was the first time I got trained abroad, never miss those moment, I was more than happy that day, so I decided to stay.</p>
<p>My third chance, here in my current company. I thought this is the right time to move. I doubt those chances would come back again for the fourth time. I always thought that joining telco industries right at it's heart was a very strategic decision for my next career path. Some colleagues told me that life will felt so stuck and slowly if I took this chance, well I heard them and I really appreciate them, but still... life is a path full of choice, right ? :)</p>
<p>My current job title here is Interconnect Billing and Retail Tariff management. Basically, billing solution can be divided into two major parts, Retail and Interconnect. Retail billing is the part where it deals with direct customers for their current balance, charging, and so on. It;s more like daily operational task. While Interconnect Billing relates to another operator. We deal with any kind of event that involved other licensed operator (OLO). While Retail Billing's usually done daily, Interconnect's cycle is only once in a month. Dispute solving, Volume Compare, Tariff Management, is our monthly tasks. We work together with the Retail Billing team, we share the CDR data, but we work in a different way.</p>
<p>Ok, that's it. Time to go to bed, tomorrow, there's still CDR waiting to be rated.</p></div>

                   <div class="clearboth"><p>Ok, since mommy wants daddy to continue this post, here comes daddy...</p>
<p>We enter the most important part in our life. It's 14 March 2006, we
held a simple but religious Akad Nikah ceremony that took place on
mommy's family house at Bukittinggi. Actually we planned to held that on
the nearest Mosque around, but it's already late night ( Isya' time was
around 8.00 PM at Bukittinggi ) so our parents decided to held the
ceremony just at home.</p>
<p>Don't ask me how nervous I was that time. My hand was so cold and sweat.
My throat also feels bad until I ask Bulek Sur for a glass of water.
Grandpa was also very nervous, his mouth indicating that he praise
Allah's name. Seeing him only made me more nervous :D</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

</div>
<p>Nervous..
And, here comes the Akad Nikah, I grab Grandpa Parjono's hand tightly,
and first try was not too good. I'm too nervous for this religious
ceremony. So Grandpa Soenarto ask me to repeat the process.&nbsp; And at the
second time, I finally spoke the whole Akad Nikah words perfectly.</p>

</div>
<p>Akad Nikah
The second part was my Mas Kawin, which is &quot;hafalan&quot; from&nbsp;a whole surah
of Al-Mulk. Here's the picture :</p>

</div>
<p>Mulk
After that, the whole process was completely done. We all can smile out,
alhamdulillah. Finally, we became husband and wife :)</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

</div>
<p>Done
We all take a rest then, and prepare for the big day tomorrow for our
wedding party at Dymens Hotel in Bukittinggi. We will post that on part
III :) A day full of smiling, and hand shaking ....</p>

                   <div class="clearboth"><p>It's 11 March 2007, when&nbsp;Grandpa and Grandma with auntie Pipot&nbsp;arrived
on Bukittinggi for my marriage. It's&nbsp;3 days before our marriage day.
Before that, Grandma already read a lot about Bukittingi, including it's
famous Nasi kapau. They just can't wait to try it. Arrived on
Minangkabau International Airport, picked up by Mas Didiek and Mbak
Reni. Bukittinggi city is a very cold and fresh city. They spent 3-5
hours for transit and plane flight from Surabaya to Padang. Their
journey then continued about 3 hours (well, that includes lunch at Sate
Mak Syukur in Padang Panjang :D). Finally they arrived at Bukittinggi.</p>
<p>At 12 March, Grandma and Grandpa want to take a trip around Bukittinggi.
Here's their picture :</p>

Yep, it's quite fun trip. Grandma and Grandpa never been this far from

                        Glassfish for Tomcat and WebMethods
                    </a>
                </h2></header>

                   <div class="clearboth"><p>These recent days I've been played around with Glassfish in my project. I have to build connectivity between our existing Card Management for Telco company product, created with pure jsp (yes, jsp treated as PHP, spaghetti or whatever you name it) to integrate with SAP. Our client provides WebMethods Integration server 6.5 as our only and only way to interact with the SAP. OK then, I grabbed some code from my previous project with Tomcat and WebMethods 6.1 and try to reuse them in this project. Well, it works. But this code only deals with connectivity. Tomcat contacts WebMethods, and that's it. All transaction maintained by WebMethods, no need to think about rollback, commit, or anything, we apply that on WebMethods's flow services. So simple and cool !. But this current project is different. Installed WebMethods dont have any license of JDBC Adapter, it only has SAP Adapter. So in order to save to database or whatever to our Card Management system, we have to build our own connectivity method. Previously we thought about creating Stored Procedure inside our database that later can be invoked by WebMethods's JDBC Adapter, but the client doesnt want to buy the license. Hmm....</p>
<p>Besides just store to database, our Card Management product also have to provide interfaces so that later on, it could synchronize any document with SAP. So SAP will hit our services if..let's say some PO created in SAP. In here, I <em>need to provide them with webservices</em> to access all of our Card Management API in proper way.</p>
<p>On other side, our Card Management also must be able to synchronize any action triggered from our side. Ok, I can use my previous code just to call the WebMethods's service, but I can not predict how long will it take. WebMethods will continue our request to SAP, and then SAP done some process inside, and after that it will returns a value to us. Based on those values, we must done an action, and after we finished done those action in our side, we must push the result back to SAP, send our document number also. I cant imagine how long the users will be wait for these sequence action. They will bury us :D</p>
<p>I see that we can divide this process by synchronous and asynchronous action. There's some action that we need to retrieve the results back from SAP immediately, such as get price. I can't do anything for this action. Saving the price list in our Card Management will blow our mandays. And other process where the users dont care whether they get the result in real time or not. They can check back later to see what happen to their process. So, in here, I <em>need a messaging service</em>.</p>
<p>So, two needs, webservice and messaging. I was thought that I will install a several products for this. Spring webservice framework to make my life easier when creating webservices (their POJO style's are really cool and simple) and ActiveMQ to provide the messaging broker. All can be integrated within our tomcat instance. But,later I also have own more concern. I must not change too many configuration on currently running tomcat instance, since it runs stable right now. And also, user portal and backend integrations are 2 different thing. The users must not feel any <strong>'world wide wait'</strong> thing when the backend process works hard to full fill their request. So here I decided to install one more instance of application servers for integration needs. And after some browsing, I decide to install Glassfish V2.</p>
<p>Why glassfish ? well, let's say, first I impressed with it's admin console. JBoss guys should really pay attention on this admin console. And secondly, I fall in love with it's support of WebServices. Glassfish support WebServices monitoring. Here I can monitor who called my webservices, on what time, what data sent, and what data returned. This is very useful when reconcile any lost datas. And the third part is, this Glassfish thing has a great messaging supports based on Sun's IMQ. I also browsed the net for this feature, and many guys out there recommends it. Last but not least, Glassfish V2 is JEE 5 compliance app.server (if not the RI itself). Creating WebServices, session EJB's and MDB's are easier with Annotations. Say good bye to deployment descriptor.</p>
<p>Ok, that's my review, maybe I'll write more about this later.</p></div>

                        Ruby Install on DSL Linux
                    </a>
                </h2></header>

                   <div class="clearboth"><p>Went home earlier than before today, after a day full of meeting with client. I missed my linux. Got a bling about ruby. This stuff sounds cool. Lot's of java programmer migrating to this language, let's give it a shot. I started my adventure by googling with some 'beginner standars' keyword regarding ruby : "howto install ruby", and I got these links :
- http://www.ruby-lang.org/id
- http://hivelogic.com/narrative/articles/ruby_rails_lighttpd_mysql_tiger?status=301</p>
<p>Great, I boot up my DSL linux under qemu, and start downloading the necessary package. I tried to install using DSL's extension facilities (MyDSL-ruby.dsl) but, I don't know if it's work. So I decided to download the source, and compile it, just like the good old days :)</p>
<p>First, I downloaded ruby <a href="ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/stable-snapshot.tar.gz">here</a>. And then as usual, run 3 commands :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">dsl</span><span class="mi">@1</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">ruby</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">1.8.6</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="err">$</span> <span class="p">.</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">configure</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">prefix</span><span class="o">=/</span><span class="n">opt</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">ruby</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">1.8.6</span>
<span class="n">dsl</span><span class="mi">@1</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">ruby</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">1.8.6</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">make</span>
<span class="n">dsl</span><span class="mi">@1</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">ruby</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">1.8.6</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">make</span> <span class="n">install</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And, I got my ruby installed in /opt/ruby-1.8.6. Dont forget to add the path reference to ruby's bin/ directory installation as follows (mine at /opt/ruby-1.8.6/bin) :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="x">export PATH=/opt/ruby-1.8.6/bin:</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="x"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>To make my life easier, I put that line in /etc/profile, and run : source /etc/profile. Check whether it points to the right path, type : irb, it should shows you some prompt like this :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">dsl</span><span class="mi">@0</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">Installer</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="n">irb</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">main</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mo">001</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Ok, I continued my journey by getting a tools called RubyGems. This RubyGems is a handy command-line tool for managing the installation of Ruby packages, like Rails ('quoted from <a href="http://hivelogic.com/narrative/articles/ruby_rails_lighttpd_mysql_tiger?status=301">here</a> ').
I downloaded it from <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=126">here</a>.
After that, I unpack it, and went inside the exploded directory and type : ruby setup.rb
This will start the installation process of RubyGems.</p>
<p>OK, next I installed Rails, what is it ?.
Quoted from http://rubyonrails.org/, ruby itself is a programming language, and Rails is the framework, just like Struts in Java. Rails is a full-stack framework for developing database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Control pattern.</p>
<p>After RubyGems installed, it's all easy to install Rails, I just have to type :
sudo gem install rails --include-dependencies
And RubyGems will download all the needs.</p>
<p>While RubyGems downloading my Rails installation, I went to next step and install PCRE and Lighttpd. PCRE is a Ruby regex extensions stands for Perl Compatible Regular Expression. I downloaded it from <a href="ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/pcre-7.4.tar.gz">here</a>. While Lighttpd is a webserver that became the default one when we choose Rails. I downloaded Lighttpd from <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/download/lighttpd-1.4.18.tar.bz2">here</a>.
First, PCRE. I run : ./configure, make, and make install. I done the same command with Lighttpd, only that I gave different prefix on each ./configure like this :</p>
<p>PCRE : </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>./configure --prefix=/opt/pcre-7.4
</pre></div>


<p>Lighttpd : </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>./configure --prefix=/opt/Lighttpd-1.4.18
</pre></div>


<p>And the rest make and make install commands were same.</p>
<p>Ok, I should be ready for rock and roll with ruby on rails.
I'll write my next experiments later. Now, it's time to get rest, we'll have a great patch deployment tomorrow :)</p></div>
