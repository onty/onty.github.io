    <p>Hello there, Assalamu'alaikum.</p>
<p>Here we present our new homepage on internet. This blog tells about&nbsp;our
family, yes...we are <strong>The Prasojo's</strong>. In this blog, you will find our
story. The story starts from the very beginning when two young people
met, and decided to marry :), until now we already had a lovely
daughter. Well, it's a little bit late to start though, since the store
already began in 2007;that means 1 year a go. Well, the idea just came
yesterday when me and my wife had a little night chat. Hey, maybe it's
gonna be great to have a family blog. Just want to write and share our
daily life to all. And later after all of our kids and daughter grow up,
they can see history of their life on internet, and opens it every time
they want. Great idea...and here we are, <strong>The Prasojo's</strong>..........</p>
<p>We welcome you to our virtual house. Hope you all enjoy our writings,
and hopefully shares the same happiness as we have here.</p>
