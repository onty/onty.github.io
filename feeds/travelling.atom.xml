My last post on this blog was in 2010, that was so 4 years a go, and where was I last 4 years ago ? Taiwan :). I remember landed here 4 years a go exactly at the same date, 19th October 2010. That was my very first international breakthrough integration projects. Yes, my first real international integration project on telecommunication industries if I may say so, because the previous one in 2007 did not actually a telecom project. It was mere an IT project where the company I work for was hired to build a web portal for an operator in Malaysia, but still, it's a web portal, it's IT, not Telecom :). First international project, alone, in a country where they don't use english on their daily live activities, what a combination. And also, that was my first year on ///, what experience do you expect from someone that just handling few telecom nodes with not-so-much experience ? Well, luckily for me, for that 2 months there, everything seem to go well. I got a lots of help from the local team, from my home base team, and also from prays that never stops from my family of course :) I learned a lots of new things, new techniques, new details that I never think of before. And what's better from all that ? I make new friends and new colleagues from around the globe. And now, 4 years later, I have moved to another country but still at the same company, and thankfully they still remember me, and invited me to come over again for another project. I really don't think this is fully because of my knowledge. I was a newbie 4 years a go, what knowledge and experience do you expect from that ? I believe this is more because of the relationship that I built with them for these past years. In Islam we call it Silaturahim, maintaining the relationship with everyone that has been worked with you. This is something I really learn from my past. I know I have let down some people by not finishing the projects they gave me when I was still in college. And I also remember some projects I couldn't finish during my first transition during the graduation and move to Jakarta. I still remember that all, and it will always be my reference to not do that again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;From Abu Hurayrah radi &amp;#39;anhu, he said, &amp;quot;I heard the Prophet Sallallaahu&amp;#39; Alaihi Wa Sallam said, &amp;#39;Whoever wants his sustenance expanded and their age extended , he shall maintain his relationship with his friends&amp;quot; (HR. Al-Bukhari no. 5986 and Muslim no. 2557).

My friend's passport were found. So, yesterday, after finishing the training, we go to the airport to get the passport back.We ride MTR train from Admiralty station to Hongkong central station. After that we changed to Airport Express train.It only took 30 minutes from downtown hongkong to reach airport.That fast ? yep.&lt;/p&gt;

I love the mass transportation railway,it's so clean, and of course, definitely fast. Everything is well organized here. I rarely seen any traffic jam in here although the street is not as wide as in Indonesia. Public transportation leave and arrive in time. In this case, who needs private vehicle ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training was great too. I have a lot question about tuning that answered here, especially in jvm tuning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Btw, you can see my photo here :

This is my first journey, to Hongkong. We will be here in 4 days, 2 days training, and 2 days for having fun, he he he. Start from subuh at 04.00 AM to the airport. After clearing customs, we proceed to our plane. We ride China Airlines. As you might guess, all languages, writings, newspapers were in chinese. Dunno, maybe my face looks like a chinese guy. Everytime the stewardess served us, they always said Xiexie to me, but to my friend next to me, they said Thankyou :)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, we stay at ChaterHouse hotel. Small and warm place. It's weird in hongkong that all building were Ruko, so the first floor used for Shop/Store, and the next floor will be their homeplace as apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oya, We spent first day with visiting police station. My friend seems to have problem with his passport, so we go to police station and ask for a memo to gave to Immigration office. But finally, in night, somebody from airport called us, he has the passport, thank god :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all, training start...
:)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tobe continued..&lt;/p&gt;
