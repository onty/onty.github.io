&lt;p&gt;We enter the most important part in our life. It's 14 March 2006, we
held a simple but religious Akad Nikah ceremony that took place on
mommy's family house at Bukittinggi. Actually we planned to held that on
the nearest Mosque around, but it's already late night ( Isya' time was
around 8.00 PM at Bukittinggi ) so our parents decided to held the
ceremony just at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't ask me how nervous I was that time. My hand was so cold and sweat.
My throat also feels bad until I ask Bulek Sur for a glass of water.
Grandpa was also very nervous, his mouth indicating that he praise
Allah's name. Seeing him only made me more nervous :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Nervous.." src="http://lh4.google.com/lintang.jp/R5MhIF0A_vI/AAAAAAAAB04/vAew0sx-Iws/P1040376.JPG?imgmax=512" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nervous..
And, here comes the Akad Nikah, I grab Grandpa Parjono's hand tightly,
and first try was not too good. I'm too nervous for this religious
ceremony. So Grandpa Soenarto ask me to repeat the process.&amp;nbsp; And at the
second time, I finally spoke the whole Akad Nikah words perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akad Nikah
The second part was my Mas Kawin, which is &amp;quot;hafalan&amp;quot; from&amp;nbsp;a whole surah
of Al-Mulk. Here's the picture :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mulk
After that, the whole process was completely done. We all can smile out,
alhamdulillah. Finally, we became husband and wife :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Done" src="http://lh4.google.com/lintang.jp/R5MhIF0A_uI/AAAAAAAAB0w/b8C7-WLvv0I/end.JPG?imgmax=512" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done
We all take a rest then, and prepare for the big day tomorrow for our
wedding party at Dymens Hotel in Bukittinggi. We will post that on part
III :) A day full of smiling, and hand shaking ....&lt;/p&gt;

on Bukittinggi for my marriage. It's&amp;nbsp;3 days before our marriage day.
Before that, Grandma already read a lot about Bukittingi, including it's
famous Nasi kapau. They just can't wait to try it. Arrived on
Minangkabau International Airport, picked up by Mas Didiek and Mbak
Reni. Bukittinggi city is a very cold and fresh city. They spent 3-5
hours for transit and plane flight from Surabaya to Padang. Their
journey then continued about 3 hours (well, that includes lunch at Sate
Mak Syukur in Padang Panjang :D). Finally they arrived at Bukittinggi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 12 March, Grandma and Grandpa want to take a trip around Bukittinggi.
Here's their picture :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Bukittinggi's Zoo
After that, they visit Jam Gadang. And there they met Mas Didiek and
Mbak Reni. Here's the picture :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pose at Jam Gadang
Yep, it's quite fun trip. Grandma and Grandpa never been this far from
home until their son married :D After few hours round trip, we finally
back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the end of Part I. Mommy will continue the story, daddy is sleepy
right now :D&lt;/p&gt;
